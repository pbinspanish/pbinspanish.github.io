<hr>
<p>As humans, we are wired to want.</p>
<p>We are constantly seeking something else to put in our possession, whether if be physical objects, feelings, people, or ideas. From an evolutionary standpoint, this makes a lot of sense. When what you have is limited, you should be working as hard as possible to get more so that you don&rsquo;t die.</p>
<p>This becomes an issue when you place a human in modern times. Most of us aren&rsquo;t living in scarcity. Our basic needs are met, what more do we need? We <em>need</em> nothing else, but we <em>want</em> so much more. Our instinct to want, to survive, turns against us in a modern society of surplus. We engage in self-destructive behavior solely because of our wants, either buying ourselves into debt or degrading our mental state through envy, or both.</p>
<p>I had thought that I had done a pretty good job of avoiding those feelings, the desire to want. Part of it was my parents, who heavily discouraged that kind of thinking, and part of it was me realizing how destructive it is. I am very intentional about spending a lot of time evaluating something before buying it, and to think about impulses before acting on them. That, and keeping the things I want far out of reach so that it doesn&rsquo;t even make sense to want them.</p>
<p>And here is where I feel I&rsquo;ve found the issue. That tendency to keep things out of reach works incredibly well <em>until the thing is no longer out of reach</em>. Once you can see it, you can taste the feeling of having it, once it&rsquo;s just an arm&rsquo;s length away, you start to want it again.</p>
<p>I made this mistake and for the past few days it absolutely killed my productivity until I realized it this morning. I had a desire that for a while was entirely outside the realm of possibility, <em>until it wasn&rsquo;t</em>. Once I realized that I could actually attain the thing I wanted, I started having those feelings of desire that distracted me from everything else.</p>
<p>The takeaway from this then is that I need to be more careful about letting things get within reach, which I think is unsustainable. The other option then is to be far more aware of my own feelings of desire, acknowledging them, and letting them pass. This option is much tougher, but I believe much more sustainable in the long term.</p>
